This work aims to build Multi-task-based QSAR models by considering multiple similar biological targets together, and make shared information transfer across from one task to another, thereby improving not only the learning efficiency, but also the prediction accuracy.

This work is based on the following Matlab libraries. You need to install them before using our codes.

The SVM model used LIBSVM library which is available at: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/.

The RF models used the randomforest-matlab library, which was developed by Abhishek Jaiantilal, and the codes are available at: https://code.google.com/p/randomforest-matlab.

The MTL models employed are based on the MALSAR library developed by Zhou et al., and the source codes of the library are available on Github at: https://github.com/jiayuzhou/MALSAR.

If you have any questions regarding MALSAR, please contact Zhili Zhao at zhaozhl@lzu.edu.cn
